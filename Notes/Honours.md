Thank you to Brodie Frail and James for these tips  

These notes are specifically tailored to BSc (Hons) Computing and similar courses

### Supervisor
+ Need to reach out to find a Supervisor AND Moderator
+ Keep regular meetings with Supervisor
+ Let supervisor know of any progress, including bottlenecks, problems
+ Don't wait until next meeting to ask supervisor for help, reach out and give them ample time
+ Keep minutes of meetings with supervisor, even things like 'no comments added' as it provides marks towards 
project management
+ Don't take supervisors word as pure gospel, you're able to make your own decisions
+ Supervisor will help you when creating own marking scheme
+ What your Supervisors etc don't know likely won't hurt your thesis/work

### Professionals/Networking
+ Contact professionals on the topic that you're working on, they will typically be very open to giving advice and/or help regarding your project
+ Contacting these professionals is also a great way to build a professional network and repore within potential employers

### Workflow
+ First 4-6 weeks or so are focused on providing tips and the setting up/start of your project
+ 10 minute presentation in February, it's likely that you'll easily fill the presentation time so don't worry about it
+ First submission in early April
+ 10k - 11k word count is the absolute limit, doesn't seem to be a penalty for going over word count but higher word counts might still be problematic
+ Conduct pre-research into your new modules and have an fair idea of what you're walking into, don't need to be an expert
+ Take more modules in T1 as T2 is a critical stage of the year
+ Work on your thesis over the Christmas holiday, it will pay off
+ You never know might happen in terms of illness etc so it would be a good idea to be prepared or even be ahead in your work just in case
+ Have a first draft ready 1 month before hand-in so that you're prepared
+ When your submission is ready, submit and get rid of it; Don't nitpick at small details
+ Make sure to treat it like a job (9 - 5 schedule)
+ Make sure to have good Work-Life balance
+ Take regular breaks through the day, around 15 mins or so
+ 30 minutes playing a game is better than 30 minutes simply TRYING to find motivation to work, while playing a game you could try to do some work during
downtime and essentially transfer/use the energy generated from playing a game for your work
+ If necessary, try to find a different place to work
+ Try to find a group of people/study group to work with in-person, even if they're working on different topics because you can all still bounce off each other in 
terms of checking writing, certain work etc. 
+ Try to make sure the work your doing is useful to the project and isn't just fluff, you can work hard and still make little to no progress
+ If you come across a hurdle, move on and come back to it. If said hurdle is holding back your project, reach out to someone to find some help
+ Finding something to reward yourself after the work day will probably make the process of creating a work-flow or daily schedule easier. Will likely also help
in motivation because during the day, you have something to look forward to when you finish up

### Modules
+ Start and finish your coursework as early as possible
+ Allocate time spend studying modules based on the number of credits (10 = not as much time, 20 = bit more time, 40 = more/most time)
+ Ensure allocated time is split equally/fairly i.e. 60% on thesis work, 40% on module work as the thesis work is more important

### Finding marks
+ Work on a very small, simple project that could complement your work even if its just to show interest/ability
+ The main focus is on how critical you are when carrying out/selecting research
+ Make sure that writing content is simple enough to be generally understood but not simplified to the point that the reader is assumed to have absolutely no 
background in anything your text discusses
