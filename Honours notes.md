### Supervisor
+ Need to reach out to find a Supervisor AND Moderator
+ Keep regular meetings with Supervisor
+ Let supervisor know of any progress, including bottlenecks, problems
+ Don't wait until next meeting to ask supervisor for help, reach out and give them ample time
+ Keep minutes of meetings with supervisor, even things like 'no comments added' as it provides marks towards 
project management
+ Don't take supervisors word as pure gospel, you're able to make your own decisions
+ Supervisor will help you when creating own marking scheme
+ What your Supervisors etc don't know likely won't hurt your thesis/work

### Professionals/Networking
+ Contact professionals in the topic that you're working on, they will typically be very open to giving advice and/or help regarding your project
+ Contacting these professionals is also a great way to build a professional network and repore within potential employers

### Workflow
+ First 4-6 weeks or so are focused on providing tips and the setting up/start of your project
+ 10 minute presentation in February
+ First submission in early April
+ 10k - 11k word count is the absolute limit
+ Conduct pre-research into your new modules and have an alright idea of what you're walking into
+ Take more modules in T1 as T2 is a critical stage of the year
+ Work over the Christmas holiday
+ Have a first draft ready 1 month before hand-in so that you're prepared
+ When your submission is ready, submit and get rid of it; Don't nitpick at small details
+ Make sure to treat it like a job (9 - 5 schedule)
+ Make sure to have good Work-Life balance
+ Take regular breaks through the day
+ 30 minutes playing a game is better than 30 minutes simply TRYING to find motivation to work, while playing a game you could try to do some work during
downtime and essentially transfer/use the energy generated from playing a game for your work
+ If necessary, try to find a different place to work
+ Try to find a group of people/study group to work with in-person, even if they're working on different topics because you can all still bounce off each other in 
terms of checking writing, certain work etc. 
+ Try to make sure the work your doing is useful to the project and isn't just fluff, you can work hard and still make little to no progress
+ If you come across a hurdle, move on and come back to it. If said hurdle is holding back your project, reach out to someone to find some help


### Finding marks
+ Work on a very small, simple project that could complement your work even if its just to show interest/ability
+ The main focus is on how critical you are when carrying out/selecting research
